The virus is supposed to look for the files in the current directory. If there are more than one files, it loads the first file which is considered as target file.
Now the copy of the virus is loaded into memory.
After that, the target file is opened and the virus is copied from the memory. After copping the code in the target file, the target file is closed.
Finally, the next file to be infected is loaded and step-3 is repeated.

Testing this virus normally may infect your computer. So, in order to test this virus program, you are recommended to follow the following steps:

Make a new empty folder in your computer.
Then, copy some executable files or any kind of files in that folder.
Run the application or .exe file of the virus. Within a few seconds, all the other files in that folder get infected.
After that, each file in that folder is a virus which can be used to re-infect.
